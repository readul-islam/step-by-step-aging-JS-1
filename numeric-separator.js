/* The numeric separator allows you to create a visual separation between groups of digits by using underscores (_) as separators.

For example, the following number is very difficult to read especially when it contains long digit repetitions: */

const number = 1000000000000000;

// now use separator and easy to read 
const num =  1_000_000_000_000_000;

// all number used separator
